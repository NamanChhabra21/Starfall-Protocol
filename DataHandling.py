DATABASE_URL = "https://rocket-gameresult-default-rtdb.asia-southeast1.firebasedatabase.app/"

"""

Question : How do I get this Database URl ?

Step-1 : Goto https://console.firebase.google.com/ --> Console
Step-2 : Login/Create Account
Step-3 : Find Realtime Database --> Create Database --> Choose test mode and select any region
step-4 : Done and copy the link ( Example: https://mygame-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/ )

Question : What if I dont want to collect data of User ?

Answer: You can leave the `DATABASE_URL` variable as `None` , it will not effect your main code
as try/except is used in `main.py` file last line.
